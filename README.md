- use *br* tag to break a paragraph into multiple lines
- use the *del* tag to display strikethrough (deleted) text
- apply line-height in CSS to adjust spacing between lines of text
- use *&nbsp* to add non-breaking spaces between word
- structure a semantic and clean README.md file
- center content vertically and horizontally using Flexbox
- upload a live version of my project with GitHub Pages

Next, I want to:
- Improve my CSS skills
- Start learning JavaScript
- Complete more Frontend Mentor challenges
